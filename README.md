Tic Tac Toe in Javascript
=========================

Codehike lessons for a JS implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, with directions given
by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/tic-tac-toe)

We start with a nine square board already created.

Overview of steps:

1. Mouse over any tile to display an "X"
2. Click any tile to permanently add an "X" and remove mouse over.
3. Alternate between "X" and an "O"
4. Display "current player" in the header
5. Prevent changing a tile once clicked once
6. Add a reset button to clear the tiles
7. Add logic to decide if a player has won
8. If the game is won, display message and freeze board
